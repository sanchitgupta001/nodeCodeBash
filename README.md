# nodeCodeBash
This repository contains basic nodeJS applications which you may like to Explore.

To get started,
1. Clone the project.
2. `cd nodeCodeBash`
3. `npm install` to install all npm dependencies required for this project's apps to work.
4. For each project, `app.js` contains the required code. So, change to the corresponding folder using `cd` and run `node app.js` to run the corresponding project.

Will be adding more projects to this repository as I write new ones.

Till then! Happy Coding. :)
